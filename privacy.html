                <p>lingk ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the lingk website (the "Service"). Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected</h2>
                <p>We believe in privacy by design. The Service is built to be used without requiring any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. We do not have a user registration, login, or sign-up system. Therefore, we do not collect, store, process, or share any personal data such as your name, email address, physical address, or password.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>2. Anonymous Usage Data (Log Data)</h2>
                <p>To improve the Service, we may collect anonymous, aggregated, non-personal information. This may include your browser type, country of origin (derived from your IP address, which is anonymized), pages visited, and the time and date of your visit. This data is used for statistical analysis of traffic and usage trends only and cannot be used to identify any individual user.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
                <p>lingk does not use cookies for user tracking, advertising, or profiling. The Service may use technically necessary local storage on your device for functional purposes, such as remembering your volume preference for the video player. This data is stored only on your browser and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
                <p>The core function of our Service is to link to third-party broadcasters and content hosts. When you play a channel, you are interacting with content served from these third parties. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external services. We encourage you to be aware when you are accessing third-party content and to read their privacy policies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we do not collect personal information, we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of our Service. The site uses HTTPS to ensure that your connection to our servers is encrypted.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
